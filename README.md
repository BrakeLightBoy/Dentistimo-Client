# Client

## Description
The client repository is the frontend of our project. Although it has some basic frontend logic, the vast majority of javascript is of course located in the distributed backend components. This Client respository is equipped with a few screens, with the first being landing page and corresponding login screen. When logged in, the user is greeted with another screen with a navigation bar for ease of use, for tasks such as booking and changing user settings.
